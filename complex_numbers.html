    <h1>Complex Numbers</h1>
    <p>Complex Numbers are mainly used to solve differential equations. A complex number is defined by its real and its imaginary part. The real part is the part we all know from "normal" numbers. The imaginary part is marked by multiplying \(j\) with a number. \(j\) is called the imaginary unit and is defined as</p>


    \begin{equation}j^2 = -1. \end{equation}

    <p>So a simple example of a complex number \(z\) would be \(z = 2 + 4j\). Here the real part \(\text{Re}(z)\) is \(2\) and the imaginary part \(\text{Im}(z)\) is \(4\).</p>
    <p>A nice way to visualize complex numbers is by showing them in a two dimensional plane, where the y-axis adds the imaginary part to the real valued x-axis.</p>
