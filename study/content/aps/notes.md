# Notes for Paper review
## Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks by Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, Jürgen Schmidhuder


### Some terms:

- **sequence learning task**: Tasks which can be learned as single steps but are in reality often learned by taking multiple steps at once to simplify the task. e.g.: sounds in speech, typing, playing an instrument, driving a car.

- **unsegmented data**: Data that has no clear indication of where the diffrent segments are. e.g.: soundwaves without clear indication of where the diffrent words of start and end, youtube video without chapter markings, text without spaces between words.

- **sub-word units**: Smaller parts of speech than words. Morphemes, stems and endings. e.g.: un|happy|ly, cat|s

- **recurrent neural network(RNN)**: A type of neural network in which neurons can send information to each other forward through time. This gives these networks memory of the states before which can be used as context for the current state.
