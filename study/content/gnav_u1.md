## Global Navigation Systems | First Exercise
### Pseudolite
A Pseudolite is a device that acts like a satallite, but in situations where an in-orbit satallite is not possible or has no reception. So for example in military conflicts, where the signal may be jammed, or during the exploration of other planet, where in-orbit satallites aren't set up yet. They are also used to just improve the GPS signal of satallites. Pseudolites are ground-based most of the time.
###Basic Principle of GPS
Lets take two transmitters(T1/T2) and a person with a receiver walking on a straight line between them.
